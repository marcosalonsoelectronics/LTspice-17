Material of video LTspice #17: BLDC Motor: PWM Control

Available at: https://youtu.be/mSlBRd1KK5w

This video shows how to implement speed and torque control for brushless DC motors using pulse width modulation (PWM). First, the important characteristics of the motor are revisited and generated by simulation. In the second part, the implementation of the PWM control is shown, including several LTspice simulations.
